          <h3>Blackjack Rules</h3>
        
          <h4>Object</h4>
        
          <p>Blackjack is a betting game played against a dealer. The object is score
          more points than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
        
          <h4>Scoring</h4>
        
          <p>Points are totaled for each card in a hand. Face cards (Jack, Queen and
          King) count as 10 points, Aces may be counted as either one or 11. All other
          cards are counted according to their numeric value.</p>
        
          <p><i>When Aces are present in a hand, the total displayed to its right
          represents the highest score, not over 21, that could be made from those
          cards.</i></p>
        
          <h4>Game Play</h4>
        
          <p>To begin a round, the player places a bet (by hitting the "Deal" button)
          and both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer's first
          card is dealt face down while all other cards are dealt face up.</p>
        
          <p>If the first two cards in a hand total 21, it's called a "blackjack" or
          "natural." The player wins with a blackjack unless the dealer also has a
          blackjack. If the dealer has a blackjack and the player doesn't, the player
          loses. If both have a blackjack, it is a tie ("push"). In any case, the round
          is over.</p>
        
          <p>When neither the dealer nor the player have blackjack, the player may take
          additional cards, one at a time ("hit"), until he or she reaches 21 or goes
          over ("busts"). The player may stop at any time ("stand"). The player loses
          if he or she busts.</p>
        
          <p>Otherwise, once the player stands, it is the dealer's turn and the
          dealer's down card is revealed. The dealer must hit if the point total is
          less than 17 and continue hitting until reaching 17 or more. If the dealer
          busts, the player wins.</p>
        
          <p>If neither the player or dealer busts, the player wins if his or her total
          is higher than the dealer's. If they tie, it is a push.</p>
        
          <h4>Betting</h4>
        
          <p>The player starts with $1000.00 credit (strictly play money) and may bet
          any amount between $5.00 and $100.00 in increments of $5.00. The player may
          change this bet amount between rounds.</p>
        
          <p>If the player wins with a blackjack, his or her bet is paid off at 3 to 2.
          Otherwise, the player is paid even money for a win. In the event of a push,
          the player's bet is returned.</p>
        
          <p>Note that a hand of three or more cards totaling 21 is not considered
          a blackjack. That is, if the player reaches 21 by hitting on a hand it is not
          an automatic win. If the player does win with such a hand, the bet is paid at
          even money.</p>
        
          <h4>Special Plays</h4>
        
          <p>After the initial deal, if neither the player nor dealer has a blackjack,
          the player has some additional options:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>The player may "split" if he or she has a pair (two cards of identical
            value, this includes any two face cards or a ten and any face card). See
            <i>Splits</i> below for details.</li>
            <li>The player may "double down," meaning that the player doubles his or
            her current bet and receives one and only one additional card.</li>
            <li>The player may "surrender," forfeiting the round and losing half of his
            or her original bet.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p><i>Buttons are automatically enabled and disabled depending on what
          actions or options are valid at any point in the game according to the
          rules.</i></p>
        
          <h4>Insurance</h4>
        
          <p>On the initial deal, if the dealer's up card is an Ace, the player is
          offered "insurance." This is a side bet equal to half of the player's
          original bet. If the player buys insurance and the dealer has blackjack, the
          player is paid 2 to 1 on this side bet. If the player buys insurance and the
          dealer does not have blackjack, the side bet is lost. In either case, the
          round continues as before with the player's original bet.</p>
        
          <p><i>When prompted to buy insurance, click "OK" to purchase or "Cancel"
          to decline.</i></p>
        
          <h4>Splits</h4>
        
          <p>When the player is dealt a pair, he or she may split. One card is removed
          and placed in a new hand with a bet equal to the amount of the player's
          original bet.</p>
        
          <p>The split hands are then played individually as follows:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>An additional card is dealt to the hand.</li>
            <li>If Aces are split, only one additional card is given to each hand (see
            <i>House Rules</i> below). The player may not hit, split or double down
            afterwards.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, after the second card has been dealt the hand may be played
            as before (hit, stand, double down, etc.) except that the player may not
            surrender on a split hand.</li>
            <li>Pairs (other than Aces) may be resplit but there is a limit to the
            total number of times the player can split (see <i>House Rules</i>
            below).</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>Once the player completes the first split hand (stands, doubles down or
          busts), the next hand is played and so on until all split hands have been
          played. Play then moves to the dealer as before.</p>
        
          <p>Note: If the additional card dealt to a split hand makes a total of 21, it
          is <i>not</i> considered a blackjack. In other words, it will pay at even
          money if the hand wins.</p>
        
          <p><i>When the player splits, the hand currently in play will be
          highlighted.</i></p>
        
          <p>Once the dealer busts or stands, each split hand is individually compared
          to the dealer's to determine a win, loss or push for the player. It is
          possible, for example, to beat the dealer on one hand but lose on the
          other.</p>
        
          <h4>House Rules</h4>
        
          <p>Blackjack rules can vary. The rules used in this game are based on typical
          Las Vegas casino rules:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>A four deck shoe is used. The player is notified whenever a new deck is
            put into play.</li>
            <li>The dealer may not hit on a soft 17, that is, when the dealer has a
            total of 17 using an Ace counted as 11.</li>
            <li>The player may double down on any initial two card hand.</li>
            <li>The player may split up to three times in any round (giving a possible
            total of four separate hands).</li>
            <li>If the player splits on Aces, only one additional card will be dealt to
            each split hand.</li>
            <li>Aces may not be resplit.</li>
          </ul>
